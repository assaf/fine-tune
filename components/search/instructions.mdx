To search against more than 200 documents, upload a file containing the documents to search through.

The file can be CSV or JSONL. It must contain a column with the name "text", and may also include the column "metadata". [More details](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/search)

For example:

```
{"text": "puppy A is happy", "metadata": "emotional state of puppy A"}
{"text": "puppy B is sad", "metadata": "emotional state of puppy B"}
```
