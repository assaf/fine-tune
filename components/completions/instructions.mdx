To fine-tune the model, first upload a file containing prompts and completions.

The file can be CSV or JSONL. It must contain two columns, "prompt" and "completion". Combined they cannot have more than 2048 tokens.  [More details](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset)

Then create a new model using that training file. You can use a second file for validating the model.

For example:

```
{ "prompt": "Company: BHFF insurance\nProduct: allround insurance\nAd:One stop shop for all your insurance needs!\nSupported:",
  "completion": "yes" }
{ "prompt": "Company: Loft conversion specialists\nProduct: -\nAd:Straight teeth in weeks!\nSupported:",
  "completion":"no" }
```
