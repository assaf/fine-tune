To classify with more than 200 examples, upload a file containing classification examples/labels.

The file can be CSV or JSONL. It must contain the columns "text" and "label", and may also include the column "metadata". [More details](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/classifications)

For example:

```
{ "text": "good film, but very glum.",
  "label": "Positive",
  "metadata": { "source": "example.com" } }
{ "text": "i sympathize with the plight of these families, but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand.",
  "label": "Negative",
  "metadata": { "source": "example.com" } }
```
